There are basically two ways to translate the messages for the Human Connection
website:

* The easier way for the so-called *regular users* with no programming knowledge 
  or even an understanding of version control system.

  [Guideline for volunteers using lokalise](lokalise-user/README.md)

* The second way might be better suited for people with programming background.
  Especially programmers might like this way to immediately update the messages
  related to their source contributions.

  [Translate manually using the git repository](translate-manually/README.md)

* In case you want to help maintain the translation environment on lokalise 
  you might want to read the following section to get an idea about those tasks.

  If you still want to help out after reading everything ;-) visit the  
  [developer's chat at Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/DFSjPaX). Introduce yourself by clicking
  *#introduce-yourself* on the left and mention *@@Mentor* to get you onboard.
